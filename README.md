## Business Problems and Solutions

### 1. Content Distribution Analysis: Movies vs. TV Shows (2017-2021)

**Content Distribution Overview** - The total count of Movies vs TV Shows in Netflix's catalog as of 2021, revealing overall content distribution.

```sql
SELECT 
  type,
  COUNT(show_id)
FROM netflix
GROUP BY
  type;
```

| Type     | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Movie    | 6131  |
| TV Show  | 2676  |


**Trend Analysis of Content Distribution** - Annual breakdown of Netflix's content additions from 2017-2021, showing the distribution between Movies and TV Shows over time.

```sql
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_added) AS year_added,
  COUNT(show_id) AS show_count
FROM netflix
WHERE
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_added) >= 2017
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_added) IS NOT NULL
  AND type = 'Movie' -- Same format for 'TV Show'
GROUP BY
  year_added
ORDER BY
  show_count DESC;
```

**Movies** ---
| Year Added | Movie Count |
| --- | --- |
| 2019 | 1,424 |
| 2020 | 1,284 |
| 2018 | 1,237 |
| 2021 | 993 |
| 2017 | 839 |

**TV Shows** ---
| Year Added | TV Show Count |
| --- | --- |
| 2020 | 595 |
| 2019 | 592 |
| 2021 | 505 |
| 2018 | 412 |
| 2017 | 349 |

**Key Findings:**

- Movies dominate the catalog with a significant 70% share (6,131 movies vs 2,676 TV shows)
- Peak content addition was in 2019-2020, with 1,424 movies added in 2019 and 595 TV shows in 2020
- Content addition showed a slight decline in 2021, dropping to 993 movies and 505 TV shows

**Strategic Implications:**

- The decline in 2021 additions may signal a shift in content strategy or impact of production delays
- Despite maintaining a movie-heavy catalog, TV show additions have grown proportionally faster since 2017
- Future strategy should evaluate whether to maintain the current movie-dominant ratio or adjust based on viewing metrics

### 2. Top 5 Content Ratings Across Movies and TV Shows
Examination of rating distributions across Movies and TV Shows in Netflix's catalog to identify predominant content ratings and potential content gaps.

```sql
SELECT
  type,
  rating,
  count(show_id) AS count
FROM netflix
WHERE
    rating NOT LIKE '%min%'
    AND rating IS NOT NULL
    AND type = 'Movie' -- Same format for 'TV Show'
GROUP BY type, rating
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Top 5 Ratings for Movies**
| Type | Rating | Count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Movie | TV-MA | 2,062 |
| Movie | TV-14 | 1,427 |
| Movie | R | 797 |
| Movie | TV-PG | 540 |
| Movie | PG-13 | 490 |


**Top 5 Ratings for TV Shows**
| Type | Rating | Count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TV Show | TV-MA | 1,145 |
| TV Show | TV-14 | 733 |
| TV Show | TV-PG | 323 |
| TV Show | TV-Y7 | 195 |
| TV Show | TV-Y | 176 |

**Key Findings:**

- Movies are dominated by mature content ratings with TV-MA (2,062) and TV-14 (1,427) being the most common ratings
- Similarly, TV Shows follow the same pattern with TV-MA (1,145) and TV-14 (733) leading the distribution
- Family-friendly content (TV-PG, TV-Y7, TV-Y) has a stronger presence in TV Shows than Movies

**Business Insights:**

- The heavy skew toward mature content suggests potential opportunities to diversify into family-friendly programming
- Consider balancing the mature content portfolio with more TV-PG rated content to capture a broader audience demographic
- Future content acquisition strategies should evaluate whether the current rating distribution aligns with target market growth objectives
  
### 3. Geographic Content Analysis: Global Contribution (2017-2021)
An analysis that examines where shows and movies are produced globally and how different regions contribute to the platform's offerings.

    END)/5 AS avg_per_year,
  COUNT (  -- Gives the 2017 count.
    CASE
      WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_added) = '2017'
      THEN show_id
      ELSE NULL
    END) AS year_2017,
  COUNT (  -- Gives the 2018 count. 
    CASE
      WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_added) = '2018'
      THEN show_id
      ELSE NULL
    END) AS year_2018,
  -- The full code continues until 2021, please see for reference.
FROM countries_unnested
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

| Germany | 42 | 40 | 58 | 45 | 34 | 33 |
| Mexico | 31 | 21 | 30 | 39 | 31 | 36 |

**Key Findings:**

- The United States dominates content production with 3,690 titles, followed by India (1,046) and the United Kingdom (806)
- US content production peaked in 2019 with 856 titles, showing a decline to 627 titles by 2021
- Asian markets show significant presence with India, Japan, and South Korea all in the top 10 content producing countries
- European content is well-represented through UK, France, Spain, and Germany, collectively contributing over 1,600 titles

**Business Insights:**

- The decline in US content production from 2019-2021 suggests an opportunity to diversify content sources and reduce dependency on a single market
- Strong presence in Asian markets indicates potential for further expansion, particularly given the success of content from South Korea and Japan
- Consider increasing investment in emerging markets like Mexico, which currently contributes the least among top 10 with only 31 titles per year on average
- European market presence could be strengthened by expanding beyond current top contributors and exploring partnerships in other European countries

    type,
    CASE
      WHEN duration LIKE '%min%' THEN CAST(TRIM(REPLACE(duration, 'min', '')) AS INT)
      WHEN duration LIKE '%Season%' THEN 
        CAST(TRIM(SUBSTRING(duration FROM 1 FOR POSITION('Season' IN duration) - 1)) AS INT)
      ELSE NULL -- Handle any other cases where duration doesn't match these patterns
    END AS clean_duration

GROUP BY duration_group
ORDER BY duration_group ASC;

-- For TV Shows, same CTE(new_duration) is used as above.

SELECT
  CASE   -- Groups TV Shows
    WHEN clean_duration <= 1 THEN '1' -- Cascading groups has been chosen to naturally align with the distribution of TV show durations.

| 1.5-2 hrs | 2,996 |
| 2-2.5 hrs | 897 |
| 2.5-3 hrs | 198 |
| 3+ hrs | 50 |

| Season Duration | Show Count |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1,793 |
| 2-3 | 624 |
| 4-6 | 193 |

| 11+ | 10 |

**Key Findings:**

- Movies average 1.66 hours in length, ranging from 3 minutes (0.05 hours) to 5.2 hours

- TV Shows average 1.8 seasons, with most shows (1,793) being single-season series
- Only 10 TV shows have more than 11 seasons, indicating a strong preference for shorter series

**Business Insights:**

- The concentration of movies in the 1.5-2 hour range suggests this is the optimal duration for new movie productions
- The high number of single-season shows indicates a potential strategy of testing concepts before committing to longer runs
- Very long movies (3+ hours) and extended TV series (11+ seasons) are rare, suggesting limited market demand for such content
- Consider focusing resources on producing more content within the proven duration ranges rather than extremely long or short content

### #7 Long Running Shows by Category

  WHERE
    type = 'TV Show' AND
    CAST(TRIM(LEFT(duration, 2)) AS INT) > 4
)

SELECT
  TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ','))) AS categories,

- Niche categories like Korean TV Shows and Science & Nature TV have minimal long-running representation (1 show each)

**Business Insights:**

- Focus development resources on comedy and drama genres, as they show the highest success rate for long-running series
- Continue investing in international content, particularly crime shows and kids' programming, which demonstrate strong sustainability
